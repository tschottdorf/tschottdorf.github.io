## Sabbatical Reading List

For the last six months, I have had the pleasure to be able to take time off
work (thanks, Cockroach Labs) to travel (some parts of) the world.

Taking time off work is, in my case, also taking time off a job that is fun and
challenging. The fun part is easily substituted by travelling, and while
travelling can also be challenging (looking at you, five days on remote beach
on Kaua'i without food or adequate shelter), it is more often physically than
intellectually so. Hence a gap to fill, with this post commemorating what
filled it (and what didn't), and perhaps an inspiration for others.

While I did have my laptop with me, it didn't see a lot of use. The original
idea was that I would do some programming, but long-distance buses and hostels
with crappy WiFi and a shortage of outlets aren't really the places to use it,
and often just letting everyone see that shiny computer you're about to leave
unprotected in your suitcase while you take a stroll around town doesn't seem
wise.

Instead, I read a lot, and most of it on my phone while not connected to the
internet.
