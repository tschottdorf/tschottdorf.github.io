Here's the recording of a talk I gave at the 15th [London Go User Group](http://www.meetup.com/Go-London-User-Group/events/223771694/) about [Cockroach DB](http://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach). I'm particularly excited about all the work that's being done on the SQL layer: In the mere 24 hours that have passed since the presentation, SQL support has already taken a couple of steps forward. It's satisfying to see it all come together.

Check our the video below or [take a look at the slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CHSFBv_8Ra_WGOq-C7H4zeiWKdx_eLKsqrQNRJjaPL0/edit#slide=id.p).

Thanks to the [London gophers](http://www.meetup.com/Go-London-User-Group/) for having me. It's only been my second time in London (the first time being a 7th grade weekend trip) and I've enjoyed it a lot.
