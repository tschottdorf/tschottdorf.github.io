I gave a [Cockroach](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach) tech talk at
[Clarifai](https://clarifai.com) a few days ago, providing an overview of the
various components of the system and, at least I hope, filling in enough detail
to get a good intuitive understanding of how everything fits together - from a
client's SQL request to the actual replication and on-disk storage.

Watch the talk (with a lot of Q&A) below:
